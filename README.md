# 4bit
> A 4 bit computer built with logic gates in Logisim.
## Features
- [x] 256 nibbles of program memory
- [x] 4 bit ALU
- [] 4 bit registers
- [] 1024 nibbles of RAM (currently 256)
- [] control unit
- [] conditional jumps
- [] lcd display (will be implemented in a similar manner to VGA, with a framebuffer in RAM)
- [] stack
- [] interrupts and input
## How will programs get flashed to the computer?
- Programs will be written in assembly
- Then assembled by a simple Arduino (Nano) program
- The Arduino will then flash the program to the computer
## Opening the project
- Open Logisim (evolution, I haven't tested it with the original)
- Open the 4bit.circ file
- Enjoy!
